# Pouch Leaflets

This repository contains Typst markup files that render
foldable leaflets that fit into 80Ã—120 mm anti-static bags,
which in turn fit snugly into the back sections of Maxpedition Micro Pocket Pouch.

It is part of my Every-Day Carry, Travel Kit, and First Aid Kits.

## Tooling

Can be run using `just` with Typst installed.
